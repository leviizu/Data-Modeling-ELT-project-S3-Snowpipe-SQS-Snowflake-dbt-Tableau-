### Using the starter project

Create user with programmatic access
Attach AWS S3 full access policy

Create a new role under another aws account
Activate â€˜third party access and assign external id

- dbt test


Built an SQS automated snowpipe pipeline that extracts and loads data from S3 to snowflake
Designed and built a hybrid(Kimball+OBT) data model
Transformed already loaded data using dbt
OBT visualised on Tableau
